          Major A Ghani was a multi-dimensional leader and a statesman who did not give in to pressure as he was above party politics. He was a rebel in uniform because he would not tolerate any instruction that went against the interest of the people.          </p>

          Events led to such a pass that he was denied a commission in the Pakistan Army, yet he had to work on the perimeter of the regiment and recruit the best young men for the regiment. It is not generally known, or question not asked why such a war veteran who organised a fighting unit fell from the favour of the administration and had to leave the army.  Understandably, if it was asked during the Pakistan days. The real reason lay in his vehement protest on the issue of speaking either Bengali or Urdu.  More on this will be covered later in details. he earned the wreath of the hierarchy. He finally was so ill that and had to be medically invalided out of army after a span of only 5 years of active service since 1948. It happened when he showed his real patriotic self by protesting on the day of raising of 1st East          </p>

          Bengal Regiment on 15th February 1948. When the local area commander the then Brig Ayub Khan articulated, ‘From now on the Bengali soldiers will speak in Urdu’. This enraged the young Captain Ghani who retorted, ‘We Bengali soldiers shall not speak in any language other than Bangali, our mother tongue’. The Area Commander shouted in front oh the distinguished gathering, ‘Shut up sit down’.  
He contested an election in his constituency in 1954 and won a historic victory as an independent candidate from his nearest rival from the ruling party. He was an active participant in the proceedings and contributed a lot to the political, social, economic and security of the country, including the discriminatory treatment of East Pakistan by the Central Government. Even when speaking at global forums, he never fails to express his unequivocal views.
He was very concerned about the country's defense and as usual relentlessly proposed training, militarization, setting up of defense industries in the then East Pakistan. 2nd March 1957
"I want to bring to the attention of the Prime Minister through you that our country is now independent. Everyone needs military training and should be provided with facilities for it. General Cadet School is required for military training. I request the Prime Minister to look into this. Every high school text

As a politician he showed his statesmanship as an independent member of the legislature in the politics of the country in his speech in the Provincial Assembly on 3 March 1957.
He strongly emphasized the need for a stable government and a sound administrative system for any development programme. He criticized the Awami League government's failure to solve the problem and alleged that the ministers were touring the country with 4-5 offices and no work would support him. "In my opinion, whoever is in charge of the minister is a qualified person.
In such a small frame it is not possible to do justice to a sketch of the life of Mej Ghoni. I am trying to establish the fact that he was a 'rebel' against oppressive institutions and did not hesitate to point them out.
Reiterating the importance of political stability, he warned the opposition not to rejoice over the resignation of 9 members from the assembly as the resignation could lead to confusion and public unrest at this point. He is from the United States.
"The resignation of 9 members from Awami League today has made many happy. A to be happy with it.
We want a government with a strong party. What will happen if the Awami League falls? If one has love for his country today, he must think about what the future holds. We want 5 years of clean politics. If the administration is not run well, East Pakistan will become another Kerala.

          Regarding the food crisis "The food crisis has reached alarming proportions and will have dire consequences if nothing is done."
On 13 March 1957 he proposed to pass an emergency resolution in the Assembly for the reorganization of the Civil Service and the separation of the Judiciary. . The resolution states:
“1. The East Pakistan Junior Civil Service will be merged with the East Pakistan Civil Service (Executive) with a view to improving the general administration of the county and accelerating the transition from executive to judicial.
2. In order to achieve parity in Central jobs, the Central Government will promptly undertake to fill up fifty percent of the vacancies in the Pakistan Civil Service and Pakistan Foreign Service cadres by suitable members of the East Pakistan Civil Service.
3. All offices under the Provincial Government shall be held only by members of the Provincial Service and officers appointed by the Central Government. Only central issues will be used for management and steps to amend the Constitution will be taken accordingly."
Such a proposal to organize and reform the entire administration of a country could only come from a highly learned, responsible and a pure politician and he was one.
He was deeply concerned for the welfare of ex-servicemen neglected by the provincial government of East Pakistan. For the welfare of the ex-servicemen of the then East Pakistan, he appealed to the government as the president of the association to improve the conditions of the ex-servicemen who had retired from the army after partition.
These are some of the many motions and discussion he brought in the Assambly and across the country. The details will be covered in various sections of the site.
