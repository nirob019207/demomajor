          When the dark shadows of World War 2 was looming over the Indian Subcontinent Major Ghani was serving in the Bengal Fire Brigade in Kolkata. He was the first Muslim Officer to join the service in 1939. I need to highlight the role of the Pioneer corps briefly for understanding. Indian Pioneer Corps may be called a franchise of Royal Pioneer Corps who fought in the European wars and were in some cases retained permanently. But in the case of Indian Subcontinent the Pioneer corps was only raised just as the threat of invasion developed from the East. So who so ever had physical fitness to work was recruited regardless of other attributes needed to make a regular fighting soldier.          </p>

          They were deemed to provide labour force to build roads, bridges, airfields, bunkers etc to help the regular soldiers fight the invading fierce life defying enemies.  However, if emergency arose, they were also given weapons to defend themselves. War changes demographics the history and national boundaries. That's what was happening during that period in the Indian Subcontinent. On one side there was famine brought by the war where the British Prime minister the so-called hero but villain on this part of the world diverted most of the resources for war mongering leaving the civil population die of starvation.  The other blatant fact emerged that the two major religious groups of the Subcontinent could not live together. The fact that the Bengali Muslims lived in the delta of Ganges River collecting the filths coming from the upstream. Bangalees were not  liked by the other ethnic groups of Bihar, Punjab, Baluch and many more who called them so called martial race          </p>

          Under this back drop of looming ominous socio political changes Capt Ghani who was assigned to fight East of Brahmaputra river to Akyab saw the brutalities of war for over three years and the impending changes to shape his mind.          </p>

          His deep awareness of the prevailing socio-political condition and the fallout from the impending partition of India could only lead to one thought that the partitioned east Bengal should have a military presence as a regular force in the national army. If the partition did not materialise then he was fully determined to have a Bengal Regiment in Indian Army.  So immediately after the cessation of hostilities the Pioneer Corps combatants were reporting to their various centres for processing for demobilisation. It was at that point the then Capt Ghani, Adjutant of Pioneer corps in Jalna, India found the best opportunity to impregnate the idea of a separate regular fighting unit out of the Pioneer Corps soldiers. He has his ‘ Band of Brothers’ to fulfil his dream. Meanwhile with the partition round the corner the British government was in a hurry to help reorganise the divided national army. The C in C of Pakistan Army was appointed a General Mesarvey. Without losing any opportunity Capt Ghani customarily congratulated the appointed C in C and highlighted the need for a regular fighting infantry unit from the would be East Pakistan. He further mentioned the p9ioneer corps who fought under him in the war provided the ready manpower who were war veterans. On reply to his letter the General gave his approval that an infantry u\ would be raised out of the          </p>

          Pioneer Corps soldiers. It was the break that he was waiting for. His Centre Commandant a Baluch Officer encouraged him to select the correct collection of personnel who could be effectively absorbed in an Infantry Battalion. Well rest is the history.

        The first East Bengal Regiment was raised at Kurmitola on 15 February 1948 and many more followed in subsequent years. The birth of East Bengal Regiment is the result of Major A Gani's foresight, efforts, perseverance and love for Bengalis and motherland.

        It will be noteworthy to note the remarks of a Commanding Officer of 1st East Bengal Regiment in 1950 which pens down some out of many qualities of Major A Ghani. It says:

<p class=" pt-5 text-neutral-600 text-base font-normal font-['Inter'] leading-relaxed">

I have the pleasure to put in record all that I know o captain A. Gani who has been in close touch with me for a couple of years.
He is a young man of towering personality combining in himself all the laudable qualities of head and heart. He has tremendous dash and drive & wonderful administrative and organizing capacity. A born leader, a marvellous speaker, he can control and command respect from all alike.
He is very popular and widely known figure in this part of the country, especially for his being Asst. Recruiting Officer in which capacity he has had opportunities and coming in contact with high officials, leading public and the masses. His suave & jovial manner, amiable and pleasant behaviour endear him to all. 
He is very hard-working, painstaking, responsible & reliable. It was due to his initiating capacity coupled with his genuine patriotic feeling s and sincere devotion and loyalty to his State the East Bengal Regiment was brought into being and which is the nucleus of the Bengali Army in Pakistan. 
A man of varied experiences in the Army, I am sure, he will be and acquisition on any Branch of the Civil Administration where Organization, Administrative & Controlling abilities are needed most.
