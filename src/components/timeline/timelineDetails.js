        desc:"It was Sunday 1st December 1919, early morning that A Ghani, founder of a the East Bengal Regiment in the village of Nagaish, under Brmanpara Upazila in Comilla district saw the first ray of light and wailed loudly to announce his arrival. He was strong and survived the harsh conditions of those period and painfully lost his loving mother when he was two and a half years of age.<br> It broke the heart of his father and did not agree with the idea of remarriage. However, seeing the condition of Ghani growing without the care of a mother he with the pressure of his relative remarried. Although he was his father’s only son, loved one but he was more attached to his uncle’s family just close by. Most of his uncles were y of his age and they filled his life.<br> They were well established as landlords and had considerable chunk of landed property. There are many anecdotes of his childhood, but I would rather leave it here to do justice to the limited space. The picture of the bungalow was not there when he was born. It was erected in 1946 after the WW 2 when he returned home with the arrears of his salary and bought it for approximately Rs 3000 from a police officer in Assam while returning home. It still stands the weathering of time after surviving many storms"

He later shifted to mainstream education under the guidance of Mr. Hamid Nomani, enrolling in Muslim High School, Chittagong. After passing his entrance exam from Khulna Zilla School at 21, Ghani attended Kolkata Islamia College, supported by Dr. Abdus Sobhan. He completed his Intermediate in Arts and enrolled in a BA program.<br>However, his studies faced challenges after Dr. Sobhan's death in 1939 and the outbreak of World War II. His educational path took a significant turn when Mr. Hamid Hasan Nomani, the Magistrate of Chittagong, recognized Ghani's potential and decided to support him. Following Nomani's advice, Ghani transferred from the madrasah to Muslim High School in Chittagong to receive a more formal education.<br>He later continued his studies at Khulna Zilla School, where he passed his entrance examination at the age of 21. Subsequently, Ghani was admitted to Kolkata Islamia College, where he was financially supported by Dr. Abdus Sobhan, his maternal uncle. At Islamia College, he completed his Intermediate in Arts and enrolled in a BA program. However, his academic pursuits faced challenges after Dr. Sobhan's untimely death in 1939 and the onset of World War II."

        desc:"When the dark shadows of World War 2 was looming over the Indian Subcontinent Major Ghani was serving in the Bengal Fire Brigade in Kolkata. He was the first Muslim Officer to join the service in 1939. I need to highlight the role of the Pioneer corps briefly for understanding. Indian Pioneer Corps may be called a franchise of Royal Pioneer Corps who fought in the European wars and were in some cases retained permanently. But in the case of Indian Subcontinent the Pioneer corps was only raised just as the threat of invasion developed from the East. So who so ever had physical fitness to work was recruited regardless of other attributes needed to make a regular fighting soldier.<br> They were deemed to provide labour force to build roads, bridges, airfields, bunkers etc to help the regular soldiers fight the invading fierce life defying enemies. However, if emergency arose, they were also given weapons to defend themselves. War changes demographics the history and national boundaries. That's what was happening during that period in the Indian Subcontinent. On one side there was famine brought by the war where the British Prime minister the so-called hero but villain on this part of the world diverted most of the resources for war mongering leaving the civil population die of starvation.<br>The other blatant fact emerged that the two major religious groups of the Subcontinent could not live together. The fact that the Bengali Muslims lived in the delta of Ganges River collecting the filths coming from the upstream. Bangalees were not liked by the other ethnic groups of Bihar, Punjab, Baluch and many more who called them so called martial race. Under this back drop of looming ominous socio political changes Capt Ghani who was assigned to fight East of Brahmaputra river to Akyab saw the brutalities of war for over three years and the impending changes to shape his mind."

        desc:"Major A Ghani was a multi-dimensional leader and a statesman who did not give in to pressure as he was above party politics. He was a rebel in uniform because he would not tolerate any instruction that went against the interest of the people. Events led to such a pass that he was denied a commission in the Pakistan Army, yet he had to work on the perimeter of the regiment and recruit the best young men for the regiment. It is not generally known, or question not asked why such a war veteran who organised a fighting unit fell from the favour of the administration and had to leave the army..<br> Understandably, if it was asked during the Pakistan days. The real reason lay in his vehement protest on the issue of speaking either Bengali or Urdu. More on this will be covered later in details. he earned the wreath of the hierarchy. He finally was so ill that and had to be medically invalided out of army after a span of only 5 years of active service since 1948. It happened when he showed his real patriotic self by protesting on the day of raising of 1st East Bengal Regiment on 15th February 1948.<br> When the local area commander the then Brig Ayub Khan articulated, ‘From now on the Bengali soldiers will speak in Urdu’.<br> This enraged the young Captain Ghani who retorted, ‘We Bengali soldiers shall not speak in any language other than Bangali, our mother tongue’. The Area Commander shouted in front oh the distinguished gathering, ‘Shut up sit down’. He contested an election in his constituency in 1954 and won a historic victory as an independent candidate from his nearest rival from the ruling party."

He delivered a memorable speech before suffering a fatal heart attack on November 11. News of his death brought profound grief to Comilla, where he was widely mourned. Arranging his body's return faced financial challenges; the government initially refused to cover the Rs 10,000 expense, but Lt. Col. M.A.G. Osmany's insistence led to the Defense Department and East Bengal Regiment offering to pay, eventually reimbursed by the government.<br> Maj Ghani was buried with full military honors in Mainamati Cantonment, Comilla. After his death, his widow, Mrs. Asiya Ghani, faced financial difficulties, managing the family with a small pension and income from handicrafts. She bought a small house in Comilla, where she raised their five children, who eventually became successful"
